                    For my Senior project as Kansas State University I designed and implemented a workout stat tracker web application that user could track running and lifting stats on. It is in what I consider its alpha state with future plans to redesign the whole app and add more features.

                        For my final project in the class Game Programming Fundamentals my group made a platformer game where the main character was a blob. My job was to implement the character movement and the flying type enemys.

                        In the summer of 2016 I was mentored by the engineering team at SMRxT Inc. They had me build a tool that they could use to test their messaging system for their product. The project was meant to give me an introduction to elm and web development in general.
