                                Hi I'm Clifford!
                                Right now I am a Senior at Kansas State University majoring in Computer Science with a 3.6 GPA. So far I have completed the core classes that focus on the fundamental concepts of programming such as learning syntax and data structures. Now I am either taking classes that are applying these concepts such as Game programming fundamentals, or delving deeper into how programming languages work with Intro to Programming Languages.
                                When I am not studying for class I like to spend my time at the gym, working on personal projects, playing video games, playing Volleyball, or reading Star Trek books. LLAP

                        Last year I join K-State's club volleyball team as an outside hitter. I quickly was put in the starting rotation on A team and have continued to have that position till now. This past year I was voted in a the treasurer of the club.

                            In my spare time I love to play video games. The 2 main genre of games I play are competitive shooters such as CSGO and call of duty, and Strategy 4x games such as Civilization, Total War, and Galactic Civilizations.
